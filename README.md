# remotely control your micro:bit from smartphone via BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy).

Download 'index.html' to your smartphone and open it,  
or access URL https://secile.github.io/micropad/

You can see screen below.
- Press '🚩' button to connect your micro:bit.
- Press '🛑' button to disconnect.

# Control.
There are three kinds of control.

1. Analog Stick

2. Button

3. Slider

# transfer message format.
On control updated, micropad send message to micro:bit via BLE. Message format is csv with 3 params 'ControlID, Value1, Value2'.  
ControlID is unique ID every control has it own. Value1 and Value2 is up to control kind.

- Analog Stick
    - ControlID: 'a1'(left stick) or 'a2'(right stick)
    - Value1: radian angle clockwise from the X axis. (rounded in 8 directions)
    - Value2: power. distance from origin. range 0.0-1.0. (rounded in 3 levels, 0.0 or 0.5 or 1.0.)
    - e.g. 'a1, 3.14, 0.5'
- Button
    - ControlID: 'b1'(X Button) or 'b2'(Y Button)
    - Value1: '1'(press) or '0'(release).
    - Value2: '0'(reserved).
    - e.g. 'b2, 1, 0'
- Slider
    - ControlID: 's1'
    - Value1: ratio with 0.0-1.0. (0.1 step)
    - Value2: '0'(reserved).
    - e.g. 's1, 0.7, 0'

# coding on micro:bit.

- on start
    - add 'bluetooth uart service' to 'on start'

- bluetooth on data received
    - receive message from micropad, parse it to 3 params, ControlID, Value1, Value2.
    - then call 'received' function which you make.

- received function
    - this is function that does you want.
    - branch by ControlID, interact actions by using Value1 and Value2.
    - here is a sample. Hero moves by Analog Stick, LED shows 'X' or 'Y' by pressing Button, and LED brightness can be changed by Slider. don't forget to add 'create sprite' in 'on start'.

- of course, don't forget to enable 'No Pairing Required'.

# customise layout of control.
modify initControl function.

for example, in case you add 3rd button 'Z', follow the instruction below.

- const button3 = new Button(...), and result.push(button3).
- onChange, asign unique Control ID. rename 'b2' to 'b3'.
- on response to 'resize' event, you have to layout it to appropriate position.

```js
// Button 3.
const button3 = new Button(canvas, context);
button3.text = "Z";
button3.onChange = (flag) => {
    const cmd = `b3,${flag? 1: 0},0`;
    sendCmd(cmd)
};
result.push(button3);
window.addEventListener('resize', () => {
    button3.setPosition(canvas.width * 0.5, canvas.height / 2 + stick2.height * 0.75);
});
```

- you can modify control style.

```js
button3.backFillStyle = "LightGreen";
button3.backStrokeStyle = "DarkGreen";
```
